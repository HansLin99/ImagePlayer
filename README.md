# ImagePlayer
***Overview***:
We used a simplified PNG class to build this program. Inside the program, we manipulated pixels using different data structures and re-color the image to make a different look. Finally, we learn about lossy compression to PNG.

## Part 1:
In this part, we cut PNG into several rectangles and put them into nodes in a chain structure(linked list). Then we changed the sequence of the nodes to re-assemble the image.


## Part 2:

Description:
Color flood algorithm using BFS/DFS and deque data structure.

## Part 3:

Description:
Lossy compression using a quadTree structure. The image is cut into pieces based on minimal entropy of splitting point.
